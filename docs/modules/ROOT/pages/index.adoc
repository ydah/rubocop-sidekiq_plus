= RuboCop Sidekiq+

Sidekiq-specific analysis for your projects, as an extension to
https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop[RuboCop].

RuboCop Sidekiq+ follows the https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/versioning.html[RuboCop versioning guide].
In a nutshell, between major versions new cops are introduced in a special `pending` status.
That means that they won't be run unless explicitly told otherwise.
RuboCop will warn on start that certain cops are neither explicitly enabled and disabled.
On a major version release, all `pending` cops are enabled.

== Project Goals

* Enforce Sidekiq best practices and safe job patterns
* Catch common reliability and performance pitfalls early
* Provide guidance for Sidekiq Pro and Enterprise features when available

== Non-goals

* Validate runtime Sidekiq configuration or operational settings
* Replace Sidekiq's own documentation and runtime checks
* Enforce application architecture or business-specific conventions
